# Minesweeper implemented in Python 3

First version [link](https://github.com/pjtoye/Minesweeper-CLI/blob/9e5228aab4bc15c2d7b710f499a2edd8abf07d50/ms.py).
Prints a minefield and instructions in the terminal. Allows the player to sweep/mark fields using text 

Second version [link](https://github.com/pjtoye/Minesweeper-CLI/blob/d74d231d4fc254435bf846e2711f0685de4a6e78/ms.py).
Adds some logic to auto-solve the minefield. The solving algorithm could use some improvement (make guesses based on probability instead of random).
